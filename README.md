# CPU Design Labs

【 NYCU 2024 spring Semester 】by Professor 葉宗泰

This repository contains a series of CPU design labs, covering single-cycle CPU, pipelined CPU, and cache management. Each lab includes Verilog/VHDL implementations and can be simulated using **ModelSim, Vivado, or Quartus**.

## 📂 Lab Overview

| Lab | Title | Description |
|----|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lab1** | Basic Single Cycle CPU | Design and implement a basic single-cycle CPU, including ALU, register file, and control unit. |
| **Lab2** | Advance Single Cycle CPU | Enhance the single-cycle CPU with additional features, such as a more complete instruction set or advanced control logic. |
| **Lab3** | Simple Pipeline CPU | Implement a basic five-stage pipelined CPU and address fundamental data hazards. |
| **Lab4** | Advance Pipeline CPU | Improve the pipelined CPU with optimizations like forwarding, branch prediction, and hazard handling. |
| **Lab5** | Implement Cache Manager | Design a simple cache manager to optimize memory access, supporting direct-mapped or set-associative caching. |
